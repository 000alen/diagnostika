      "titulo": "Atrial fibrillation",
      "overview": "Atrial fibrillation  Atrial fibrillation Atrial fibrillation In a typical heart, a tiny group of cells at the sinus node sends out an electrical signal. The signal travels through the heart's upper chambers to the atrioventricular (AV) node. The signal then passes into the lower heart chambers, causing them to squeeze and pump out blood. In atrial fibrillation, electrical signals fire from many locations in the upper chambers, causing them to beat chaotically. Since the AV node doesn't prevent all of these chaotic signals from entering the lower chambers, the heart beats faster and irregularly., Atrial fibrillation (AFib) is an irregular and often very rapid heart rhythm. An irregular heart rhythm is called an arrhythmia. AFib can lead to blood clots in the heart. The condition also increases the risk of stroke, heart failure and other heart-related complications., , During atrial fibrillation, the heart's upper chambers \u2014 called the atria \u2014 beat chaotically and irregularly. They beat out of sync with the lower heart chambers, called the ventricles. For many people, AFib may have no symptoms. But AFib may cause a fast, pounding heartbeat, shortness of breath or light-headedness., Episodes of atrial fibrillation may come and go, or they may be persistent. AFib itself usually isn't life-threatening. But it's a serious medical condition that needs proper treatment to prevent stroke., Treatment for atrial fibrillation may include medicines, therapy to shock the heart back to a regular rhythm and procedures to block faulty heart signals., A person with atrial fibrillation also may have a related heart rhythm problem called atrial flutter. The treatments for AFib and atrial flutter are similar.,",
      "sintomas": "Symptoms of AFib may include:, Feelings of a fast, fluttering or pounding heartbeat, called palpitations. Chest pain. Dizziness. Fatigue. Lightheadedness. Reduced ability to exercise. Shortness of breath. Weakness., Some people with atrial fibrillation (AFib) don't notice any symptoms., Atrial fibrillation may be:, Occasional, also called paroxysmal atrial fibrillation. AFib symptoms come and go. The symptoms usually last for a few minutes to hours. Some people have symptoms for as long as a week. The episodes can happen repeatedly. Symptoms might go away on their own. Some people with occasional AFib need treatment. Persistent. The irregular heartbeat is constant. The heart rhythm does not reset on its own. If symptoms occur, medical treatment is needed to correct the heart rhythm. Long-standing persistent. This type of AFib is constant and lasts longer than 12 months. Medicines or a procedure are needed to correct the irregular heartbeat. Permanent. In this type of atrial fibrillation, the irregular heart rhythm can't be reset. Medicines are needed to control the heart rate and to prevent blood clots.",
      "risk_factors": "Things that can increase the risk of atrial fibrillation (AFib) include:, Age. The risk of AFib increases as you grow older. Caffeine, nicotine or illegal drug use. Caffeine, nicotine and some illegal drugs \u2014 such as amphetamines and cocaine \u2014 can cause your heart to beat faster. Use of these substances may lead to the development of more-serious arrhythmias. Drinking too much alcohol. Drinking too much alcohol can affect the electrical signals in the heart. This can increase the risk of atrial fibrillation. Changes in the level of body minerals. Minerals in the blood called electrolytes \u2014 such as potassium, sodium, calcium and magnesium \u2014 help the heart beat. If these substances are too low or too high, irregular heartbeats may occur. Family history. An increased risk of atrial fibrillation occurs in some families. Heart problems or heart surgery. Coronary artery disease, heart valve disease and heart problems present at birth increase the risk of AFib. A history of heart attack or heart surgery also makes a person more likely to get the condition. High blood pressure. Having high blood pressure increases the risk of getting coronary artery disease. Over time, high blood pressure may cause part of the heart to become stiff and thick. This can change how heartbeat signals travel through the heart. Obesity. People who have obesity are at higher risk of developing atrial fibrillation. Other long-term health conditions. You may be more likely to get AFib if you have diabetes, chronic kidney disease, lung disease or sleep apnea. Some medicines and supplements. Some prescription medicines and certain cough and cold remedies bought without a prescription can cause irregular heartbeats. Thyroid disease. Having an overactive thyroid gland can raise the risk of irregular heartbeats."

      "titulo": "Abdominal aortic aneurysm",
      "overview": "Abdominal aortic aneurysm  Abdominal aortic aneurysm Abdominal aortic aneurysm An abdominal aortic aneurysm occurs when a lower part of the body's main artery, called the aorta, becomes weakened and bulges., An abdominal aortic aneurysm is an enlarged area in the lower part of the body's main artery, called the aorta. The aorta runs from the heart through the center of the chest and belly area, called the abdomen., The aorta is the largest blood vessel in the body. An abdominal aortic aneurysm that ruptures can cause life-threatening bleeding., , Treatment depends on the size of the aneurysm and how fast it's growing. Treatment varies from regular health checkups and imaging tests to emergency surgery.",
      "sintomas": "Abdominal aortic aneurysms often grow slowly without noticeable symptoms. This makes them difficult to detect. Some aneurysms never rupture. Many start small and stay small. Others grow larger over time, sometimes quickly., If you have a growing abdominal aortic aneurysm, you might notice:, Deep, constant pain in the belly area or side of the belly. Back pain. A pulse near the bellybutton.",
      "risk_factors": "Abdominal aortic aneurysm risk factors include:, Tobacco use. Smoking is the strongest risk factor for aortic aneurysms. Smoking can weaken the walls of blood vessels, including the aorta. This raises the risk of aortic aneurysm and aneurysm rupture. The longer and more you use tobacco, the greater the chances are of developing an aortic aneurysm. Men ages 65 to 75 who are current or former smokers should have a one-time ultrasound to screen for an abdominal aortic aneurysm. Age. Abdominal aortic aneurysms occur most often in people age 65 and older. Being male. Men develop abdominal aortic aneurysms much more often than women do. Being white. People who are white are at higher risk of abdominal aortic aneurysms. Family history. Having a family history of abdominal aortic aneurysms increases the risk of having the condition. Other aneurysms. Having an aneurysm in the aorta in the chest (thoracic aortic aneurysm) or in another large blood vessel, such as the artery behind the knee, might increase the risk of an abdominal aortic aneurysm., If you're at risk of an aortic aneurysm, medicines may be given to lower your blood pressure and relieve stress on weakened arteries."

      "titulo": "Hyperhidrosis",
      "overview": "Hyperhidrosis (hi-pur-hi-DROE-sis) is excessive sweating that's not always related to heat or exercise. You may sweat so much that it soaks through your clothes or drips off your hands. Heavy sweating can disrupt your day and cause social anxiety and embarrassment., Hyperhidrosis treatment usually helps. It often begins with antiperspirants. If these don't help, you may need to try different medications and therapies. In severe cases, your health care provider may suggest surgery to remove the sweat glands or to disconnect the nerves related to producing too much sweat., , Sometimes an underlying condition may be found and treated.,",
      "sintomas": "The main symptom of hyperhidrosis is heavy sweating. This goes beyond the sweating from being in a hot environment, exercising, or feeling anxious or stressed. The type of hyperhidrosis that usually affects the hands, feet, underarms or face causes at least one episode a week when you're awake. And the sweating usually happens on both sides of the body.",
      "risk_factors": "Risk factors for hyperhidrosis include:, Having a blood relative, such as a parent, sibling or grandparent, who sweats heavily Taking medicines or supplements that cause sweating Having a medical condition that causes sweating"

      "titulo": "Absence seizure",
      "overview": "Absence seizures involve brief, sudden lapses of consciousness. They're more common in children than in adults., A person having an absence seizure may stare blankly into space for a few seconds. Then the person typically returns quickly to being alert. This type of seizure usually doesn't lead to physical injury. But injury can result during the period when the person loses consciousness. This is particularly true if someone is driving a car or riding a bike when the seizure happens., , Absence seizures usually can be controlled with anti-seizure medicines. Some children who have them also develop other seizures, such as generalized tonic-clonic seizures or myoclonic seizures. Many children outgrow absence seizures in their teens.,",
      "sintomas": "A simple absence seizure causes a vacant stare, which may be mistaken for a brief lapse in attention. The seizure lasts about 10 seconds, though it may last as long as 30 seconds. There's no confusion, headache or drowsiness after the seizure., Symptoms of absence seizures include:, A sudden stop in activity without falling. Lip smacking. Eyelid flutters. Chewing motions. Finger rubbing. Small movements of both hands., Afterward, there's usually no memory of the incident. But if the seizure is longer, the person may be aware of missed time. Some people have many episodes daily. When it happens, it can interfere with school or daily activities., A child may have absence seizures for some time before an adult notices them. This is because the seizures are so brief. A decline in a child's learning ability may be the first sign of the seizure disorder. Teachers may say the child has trouble paying attention or that a child is often daydreaming.",
      "risk_factors": "Certain factors are common to children who have absence seizures, including:, Age. Absence seizures are more common in children between the ages of 4 and 14. Sex. Absence seizures are more common in females. Family members who have seizures. Nearly a quarter of children with absence seizures have a close relative who has seizures."

      "titulo": "Achalasia",
      "overview": "Achalasia is a swallowing condition that affects the tube connecting the mouth and the stomach, called the esophagus. Damaged nerves make it hard for the muscles of the esophagus to squeeze food and liquid into the stomach. Food then collects in the esophagus, sometimes fermenting and washing back up into the mouth. This fermented food can taste bitter., , Achalasia is a fairly rare condition. Some people mistake it for gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD). However, in achalasia, the food is coming from the esophagus. In GERD, the material comes from the stomach., There's no cure for achalasia. Once the esophagus is damaged, the muscles cannot work properly again. But symptoms can usually be managed with endoscopy, minimally invasive therapy or surgery.,",
      "sintomas": "Achalasia symptoms generally appear gradually and get worse over time. Symptoms may include:, Difficulty swallowing, called dysphagia, which may feel like food or drink is stuck in the throat. Swallowed food or saliva flowing back into the throat. Heartburn. Belching. Chest pain that comes and goes. Coughing at night. Pneumonia from getting food in the lungs. Weight loss.
